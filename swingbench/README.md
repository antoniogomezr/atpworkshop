Start using Swingbench
Change to the “bin” subdirectory where swingbench is installed. In this example: its:
/home/opc/Downloads/swingbench/bin

And start swingbench by issuing the command below (see screenshot and explanation of parameters below) (make sure to use your wallet and ATP database user/password information, fields that need to be modified to your values are in black). Notice the command below will create a database user name “soe” (-u soe with a password “Atpxweek2018” (-p Atpxweek2018) which will be used by Swingbench to load data and run workloads.
